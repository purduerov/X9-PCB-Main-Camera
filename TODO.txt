TODO:
	- Make the traces D_M and D_P the same length.  Use the command "run length" to determine the length of each trace.
	- Shorten the D_M and D_P traces so that they go to the right and then down.  You have them going right then down then up.
	- Have Charles and/or I(Luke) look over your schematic.  Some of the connections to parts don't seem to be correct.
	- Swap some of the connections for the board to binder connector.  Swap "PWN" and +3.3V.  Not sure if you now this, but the correct name is PWM (pulse width modulaton).
	- Talk to Alex Ruffino in order to figure out the hole placement in order to mount the servo.
	- Make sure with Alex that we are making the board properlly so that we can mount the 3D printed laser mounting cones on the board.
	-Move the laser voltage trace out of the way of the hole that is going to be in the the middle of the board, because the camera needs to go through there
